Google Cloud Trace API R library

Send and retrieve trace data from Google Cloud Trace. Data is generated and available by default for all App Engine applications. Data from other applications can be written to Cloud Trace for display, reporting, and analysis.
This is an R package autogenerated via [googleAuthR](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleAuthR)'s Discovery API builder. 
The Google Documentation for this API is [here](https://cloud.google.com/tools/cloud-trace).

## Features 
 * Auto generated R functions for every method and object in the API
 * Passes CRAN checks in skeleton form
 * Auto-creates R package files via `devtools`
 * Auto-documentation of function arguments
 * Type-checking of passed objects
 * Ability to quickly add new features of the API as they are published.

## Authentication
Set the appropriate Google API scopes:

```r
library(googleAuthR)
library(googlecloudtracev1.auto)
options(googleAuthR.scopes.selected = c('https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/trace.append', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/trace.readonly'))

gar_auth()
```
 See the documentation for the package starting at `?googlecloudtracev1.auto`
## Useage
The intention is for these auto-generated packages to be used as a basis for proper R packages suitable for CRAN.
Fork this package, and then use the generated functions and objects to make what you need.
Things you may want to do are:
* Create parsing functions to make the API responses into more user-friendly forms
* Create wrapper functions and objects around the API calls into more user-friendly forms
* Create documentation, vignette's and examples
