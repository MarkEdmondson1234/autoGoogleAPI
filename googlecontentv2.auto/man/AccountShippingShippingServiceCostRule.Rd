Building block of the cost calculation decision tree.  - The tree root should have no condition and no calculation method.- All the children must have a condition on the same dimension. The first child matching a condition is entered, therefore, price and weight conditions form contiguous intervals.- The last child of an element must have no condition and matches all elements not previously matched.- Children and calculation method are mutually exclusive, and exactly one of them must be defined; the root must only have children.
