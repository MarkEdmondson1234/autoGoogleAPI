\title{List the data points of the time series that match the metric and labels values and that have data points in the interval. Large responses are paginated; use the nextPageToken returned in the response to request subsequent pages of results by setting the pageToken query parameter to the value of the nextPageToken.}
\usage{
timeseries.list(ListTimeseriesRequest, project, metric, youngest,
  aggregator = NULL, count = NULL, labels = NULL, oldest = NULL,
  pageToken = NULL, timespan = NULL, window = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ListTimeseriesRequest}{The \link{ListTimeseriesRequest} object to pass to this method}

\item{project}{The project ID to which this time series belongs}

\item{metric}{Metric names are protocol-free URLs as listed in the Supported Metrics page}

\item{youngest}{End of the time interval (inclusive), which is expressed as an RFC 3339 timestamp}

\item{aggregator}{The aggregation function that will reduce the data points in each window to a single point}

\item{count}{Maximum number of data points per page, which is used for pagination of results}

\item{labels}{A collection of labels for the matching time series, which are represented as:}

\item{oldest}{Start of the time interval (exclusive), which is expressed as an RFC 3339 timestamp}

\item{pageToken}{The pagination token, which is used to page through large result sets}

\item{timespan}{Length of the time interval to query, which is an alternative way to declare the interval: (youngest - timespan, youngest]}

\item{window}{The sampling window}
