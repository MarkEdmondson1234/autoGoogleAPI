Google Classroom API R library

Manages classes, rosters, and invitations in Google Classroom.
This is an R package autogenerated via [googleAuthR](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleAuthR)'s Discovery API builder. 
The Google Documentation for this API is [here](https://developers.google.com/classroom/).

## Features 
 * Auto generated R functions for every method and object in the API
 * Passes CRAN checks in skeleton form
 * Auto-creates R package files via `devtools`
 * Auto-documentation of function arguments
 * Type-checking of passed objects
 * Ability to quickly add new features of the API as they are published.

## Authentication
Set the appropriate Google API scopes:

```r
library(googleAuthR)
library(googleclassroomv1.auto)
options(googleAuthR.scopes.selected = c('https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.course-work.readonly', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.courses', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.courses.readonly', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.coursework.me', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.coursework.me.readonly', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.coursework.students', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.coursework.students.readonly', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.profile.emails', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.profile.photos', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.rosters', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.rosters.readonly', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.student-submissions.me.readonly', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.student-submissions.students.readonly'))

## Useage
The intention is for these auto-generated packages to be used as a basis for proper R packages suitable for CRAN.
Fork this package, and then use the generated functions and objects to make what you need.
Things you may want to do are:
* Create parsing functions to make the API responses into more user-friendly forms
* Create wrapper functions and objects around the API calls into more user-friendly forms
* Create documentation, vignette's and examples
